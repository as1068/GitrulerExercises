# GitRuler Extra Git Exercises 

If you do not already have a your own repository for these exercises [fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). Clone this repository

## Configuring GitIgnore Files And Branching

To make sure that your are correctly listed as an editor in the history of a file you must configure `git` on each new machine (or network if your profile follows you around).

1. Run Gitruler to initialise the exercises.
1. Cofigure a `.gitignore` file and ignore all XML files within the folder `files/tv shows`.
1. Stage and commit this change with the line `Ignore XML Files`.
1. Create a new branch in this repository called `new-branch-1` from master.
1. In the `new-branch-1` add `Boston Celtics` to a new line in `files/basketball.txt`. Commit this change with the message `NBA Champions 2019`
1. Switch back to the `master` branch, and merge all changes from the `new-branch-1` branch into the `master` branch.

## Submitting the results

Once the exercise is complete, push this repository to the remote. If there are multiple branches for an exercise, make sure that you push them all. Check github afterwards to make sure all files were commited and pushed correctly.

To ensure that you have you correctly pushed everything that you need to, you could clone the remote repository into a separate folder and re-run gitruler.
